<h3>Developed by Chris Petropoulos</h3></br>

<h4>Description</h4>
<p>
Ano-DNS acts as a DNS server.</br>
However, it is not a real DNS server.</br>
What Ano-DNS does is to mediate a client's </br>
query to a real DNS server and then send </br>
the results back to the client.</br>
</br>
By this way the user can "hide" to the</br>
real DNS server provider what he/she visits.</br>

<h4>Compile</h4>
<p>To compile just use Make</p>
